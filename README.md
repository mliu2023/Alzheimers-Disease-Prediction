# Alzheimer-brain-MRI-image-classification

This repository is dedicated to the research I conducted at the 2022 Advanced Academy for Research and Development summer program.  To run the file, you need a data folder with train, test, and val folders, each containing the brain MRI images.  The CNN uses pretrained VGG16 layers connected to a batch normalization layer followed by alternating layers of 1000 neurons and 0.6 dropout.
